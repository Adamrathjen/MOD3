# Overview

The game can be played immediatly when started, movement can be done with either the arrow keys of the WASD keys
and hitting the moles is done with the space bar

I wrote this program to explore the world of game creation and test my hand at making a basic game.
The experience was extremely helpful and showed me a lot of how the magic happens.
